# EECS448 Project 3 - Snake Game Prototyping

In this project for EECS 448, we chose to code an application that runs the snake game.

## Snake Game

The Snake Game, otherwise known as "Snake" made it's debut in 1997. It has since had many versions, updates, and spin-offs across many platforms.

The object of the game is to make your snake fill up the entire playing board. You may eat "apples" along the way to gain length, but be careful, because if you attempt to eat a border or yourself, you instantly lose!
